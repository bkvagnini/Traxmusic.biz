Traxmusic.biz is for Music Producers who need to be able to keep
track of the production process, without resorting to white boards
or big sheets of posterboard.

This allows them to see, at a glance, that they need to record the
 bass part for song #4 and the guitar, keyboards and kazoo parts for
 song #6.

This is to be a web app, updateable in realtime and viewable by the world.

Phase 1- Make it work for a single user

Phase 2- Allow for multiple users with dif profiles and projects

Phase 3- Allow for easy installation on your own webserver (e.g., not tied 
 to having to use my server- sim. to Wordpress 
 (Wordpress.org vs. Wordpress.com)

Phase 4- Allow for installation within the bands Facebook page, allowing
 the band to update in realtime as tracks get recorded, and allowing fans
 to see the tracks being finished, all in real time
